                        <p class="">
                            This application is a stand alone application and is in no way tied to OOU's Students Portal or websites as at this period.
                            Therefore, you are adviced to go to your dashboard on the school's portal and write out the following on a piece of
                            paper <b>Course Code</b>, <b>Course Units</b>, <b>Score</b>, <b>Semester & Level</b> of each course you did in each semester
                            of the academic year you wish to add to your dashboard on this application. This is a one time activity, as your inputs will
                            always be stored in this application and readily available for future references as you don't have to go through all the stress
                            anymore. <br/>
                            <b>I'm so sorry for the stress. I don't have access to the School's database.</b>

                            Every course in OOU has a Course unit <b>(CU)</b>. Therefore to get the Quality Point <b>(QP)</b> for a particular
                            course in any semester, OOU multiplies the Course Unit (CU) by the Grade Point <b>(GP)</b> earned by the student
                            in that particular course. <br/><br/>
                            <b>For Example:</b> Lanre signed up for 20 Course units in Rain Semester, and got a Quality Point of
                            85 for that Semester. Therefore, OOU calculates Lanre's Grade Point Average <b>GPA</b> for that particular semester using the formula
                            <b>GPA = QP/CU</b><br/>
                            <b>GPA = 85/20</b><br/>
                            <b>GPA = 4.25</b><br/>
                            Therefore Lanre's GPA for Rain Semester is <b>4.25</b>
